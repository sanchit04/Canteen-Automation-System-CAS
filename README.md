System which will make your food ordering a great experience

## INTRODUCTION--
The project “Canteen Automation System” enables the end users to register online, read and select the food from e-menu card and order food online by just selecting the food that the user want to have using web application. The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear on the screen near the Chef who is going to cook the food for you. By using this application the work of the staff is reduced and we can also say that the work is nullified.
